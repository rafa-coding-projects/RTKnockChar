# RTKnockChar

Code related to the simulations done in the paper [**"Real-time knock characterization using adaptive filters and power estimators"**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9083981).

This set of files simulate the knock phenomenon over different scenarios as decribed in the paper. Such scenarios are used as a test to adaptive predictors combined with a power estimator.

## 1. Instructions

In order to reproduce the plots presented in the paper, please run 'run_all.m' following the same folder structure in this repository. The plots should be generated automatically.

Under data folder you can see the ".mat" file with the simulated knock for each scenario.
